          Hello, I'm Tyler.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a student, and in my spare time, I program computers.
        </p>
        <p>
          I work with arduinos, and strange, small engineering projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been programming ever since I was 8, starting with basic courses such as on <a href="https://www.code.org" class="link">Code.org</a> and especially <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" class="link">Codecademy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Codecademy was integral to my skill as a coder. However, I never really got serious until I was 12.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I entered High School, my skills began to rapidly improve, and now I'm here, designing this website.
          <!-- Like, right now, when I'm typing this real comment.-->
        </p>
        <p>
          So far, I've just been hopping between projects, working on the stuff I feel is interesting, and engaging.
        </p>
        <p>                                                       <!--If anyone bothers with allowing mailto-->
          If you want to get in touch, I'm available at <a href="mailto:tyly04@gmail.com">tyly04@gmail.com</a>, and I should get back to you within a couple days. <!--I don't get a lot of email.-->
